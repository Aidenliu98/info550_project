In the project, I will use data from Machine Learning Repository (archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/php) which collected several factors and their quality of 1600 bottles of wines in 2009. I will use basic statistical analysis such as grouping statistics and regression analysis and use several test methods to test the final output model. The output will contain the basic statistical characteristic and relations between factors and the equality of the wines.  I will use SAS as the main analyse software and may use tableau or python(Panda) for the visualization part.
