# MY PROJECT
In my project, I will analyze the wine.csv data
To analyze it , we need to install some R packages. You can install the packages by the following code.
```{r}
installed_pksg <- row.names(installed.packages())
pkgs<-c("ggpolt2", "car", "MASS")
for (p in pkgs){
	if(!(p %in% install_pkgs)){
		install.packages(p)
	}
}

```

# EXECUTE THE ANALYSIS
If you want to execute my analysis, you can run the following code from the folder
```{linux}

```
